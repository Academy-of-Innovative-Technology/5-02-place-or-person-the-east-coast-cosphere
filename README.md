  ## HTML

 - Design the page using any html5 or bootstrap tags
 - improve the page creatively than using the template

  ## CSS
		
 -  Use creative but consistent colors that makes sense.

		
# Challenge
		
  - create the template dynamically.

  - use a drop down menu

  - the drop down is dynamically populated with your countries name

  - use Object.keys() and Object.values in a function.
 
  - use a single function that passes a parameter to search for the object.
